
## recipebase
---
An application for creating and storing recipes with the help of a database of ingredients.

Users may create and publish recipes to be browsed and searched for by other users. Ingredients used in a recipe are stored in the database, and can be quickly retrieved for use in new recipes and assigned properties such as a category and a kcal value per unit for sorting options and a more informative presentation of a recipe. 

Ingredients are user-specific and can only be viewed, edited and deleted by the creating user. Recipes added to the database can be viewed by all visitors.
