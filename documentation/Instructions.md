## Instructions for use

As an unauthorized user, you may only search for and view recipes in the database. To create a user account, navigate to `Sign up`, enter a name, unique username and password and confirm. Log in with your credentials to start using the application.

Once logged in, your name is displayed on the right hand side of the navigation bar. Click on your name to open a drop down menu with the option to log out.

#### Creating a recipe
From the navigation bar, open the dropdown menu `Recipes` and select `Add a recipe`. 
On the recipe creation page, you can start writing down your recipe in the input fields assigned for recipe name, servings, instructions and ingredients.

Ingredients are added by entering an ingredient's name, amount and optional unit of measurement. If you have previously created a recipe or manually added ingredients to the database, entering text in the ingredient name field will open a dropdown menu if the text matches any existing ingredient names. Navigate the dropdown menu with arrow keys or click on a menu item to fill the name and unit fields. When selecting an ingredient in this manner, unit is assigned according to the default unit property of an ingredient in the database. You may change the default unit by editing an ingredient. This does not prevent you from assigining a unit different from the default.

Clicking `Add` will add the ingredient to this recipe's list of ingredients below the input fields. Clicking the `X` next to an added ingredient will remove the ingredient from the list.

Once your recipe is finished, click on `Create recipe` to add it to the database along with any ingredients not already in the database for your account.

#### Searching for and browsing recipes
Click on the `recipebase` text in the navigation bar or go to the site's home address. By default the view will list all recipes in the database below the search field.

To search, enter a search term in the text field and select whether you want to match recipe names, ingredient names or ingredient categories. Clicking on `Search` will bring up the search results below along with information regarding which items were matched in each recipe by the search term. If a recipe in the listing was created by you, there will also be links to `Edit` or `Delete` the recipe. 

Clicking on a recipe name in the listing will show the recipe on a new page. You may change the amount of servings by changing the value in the servings field and ingredient amounts will be adjusted accordingly.

The total calorie value of a recipe is displayed below the servings field and will be adjusted according to amount of servings. If any ingredient used in the recipe is missing a kcal value, there will be a disclaimer below the calorie value. 

Kcal values are counted only for those ingredients that use their default units in the recipe. In other words: for an ingredient's kcal value to be used in a recipe, its unit must be the same in the recipe as the value listed as its default unit in the database, viewable and editable in the listing of ingredients accessed by `Ingredients` in the navigation bar.  

`My recipes` in the `Recipes` dropdown menu will list all recipes created by you.

#### Editing a recipe
Clicking `Edit` either from the recipe or search result view will open up the recipe on the same page that is used for creating a recipe, and editing it works the same way as during creation.

#### Ingredients
Selecting `Ingredients` from the top navigation bar will bring up a table listing of all ingredients existing in the database for your account. On the right hand side form, you may enter the details (name, default unit, category, kcal value per default unit) of a new ingredient and add it to the database. Clicking on the `Edit` button of an ingredient in the table view will bring up the details of an ingredient for editing. 
Clicking `Delete` will simply delete the ingredient.
