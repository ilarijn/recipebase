## Instructions for use

As an unauthorized user, you may only search for and view recipes in the database. Navigate to `Sign up`, choose a name, unique username and password and create and account. Log in with your credentials to start using the application.

Once logged in, your name is displayed on the right hand side of the navigation bar. Click on your name for the option to log out.

#### Creating a recipe
From the navigation bar, open the drop down menu `Recipes` and select `Add a recipe`. 
On the recipe creation page, you can start writing down your recipe in the input fields assigned for recipe name, servings, instructions and ingredients.

Ingredients are added by entering an ingredient's name, amount and optional unit of measurement. If you have previously created a recipe or manually added ingredients to the database, entering text in the ingredient name field will open a drop down menu if the text matches any existing ingredient names. Navigate the drop down menu with arrow keys or click on a menu item to fill the ingredient fields.

 Clicking `Add` will add the ingredient to this recipe's list of ingredients below the input fields. Clicking the `X` next to an added ingredient will remove the ingredient from the list.

Once your recipe is finished, click on `Create recipe` to add it to the database along with any ingredients not already in the database for your account.

#### Searching for and browsing recipes
To search for recipes, click on the `recipebase` text in the navigation bar or go to the site's home address. Enter a search term in the text field and select whether you want to match recipe names, ingredient names or ingredient categories. Clicking on `Search` will bring up the search results below along with information regarding which items were matched in each recipe by the search term. If a recipe in the listing was created by you, there will also be links to `Edit` or `Delete` the recipe. 

Clicking on a recipe name in the listing will show the recipe on a new page. You may change the amount of servings by entering a new value in the servings field and ingredient amounts will be adjusted accordingly.

`List recipes` in the `Recipes` drop down menu is simply a listing of all recipes in the database.

#### Editing a recipe
Clicking `Edit` either from the recipe or search result view will open up the recipe on the same page that is used for creating a recipe, and editing it works the same way as during creation.

#### Ingredients
Selecting `Ingredients` from the top navigation bar will bring up a table listing of all ingredients existing in the database for your account. On the right hand side form, you may enter the details of a new ingredient and add it to the database. Clicking on the `Edit` button of an ingredient in the table view will bring up the details of an ingredient for editing.
